## Introduction

This project is a full-stack web application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It demonstrates the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, providing a comprehensive example of how these operations can be implemented in a modern web application.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to serve as a learning tool and a reference for developers who want to understand how to build and integrate a full-stack application using the PERN stack. It showcases the best practices for setting up a backend server with Express.js and Node.js, managing a PostgreSQL database, and creating a dynamic front-end interface with React.
